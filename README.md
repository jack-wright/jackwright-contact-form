This is a simple contact form plugin that has client and server side validation, and the ability to view and export a message table as a CSV amongst other things.

Once activated the plugin will create a table in your websites database for messages, and this will be populated anytime someone sends you a message. You will also be sent an email and shown a success message.

In the admin page for the plugin is the shortcode that is needed to use the plugin. Place that anywhere on your site, and as long as the plugin is active, it will show and work. There is also a table on this page with the message data from when the table was first set up. I used DataTables to create this table as it is clean and easy to use. It also has the added bonus of being able to do a number of things, including export as a CSV which was one of the requirements of the task I was set.
